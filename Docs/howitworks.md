# How the Joystick module works

The X and Y parts of the circuit are identical. Each uses four op amps from a TL074 chip. Input to the first inverting op amp stage (U1A) is the voltage from a voltage divider consisting of a joystick pot and two fixed resistors (R1, R2). That voltage, in the range of about ±2.5 V, is scaled by a gain of up to -1 controlled by the range pot. The next stage (U1B) adds an offset that comes from a voltage divider consisting of the offset pot and two fixed resistors (R4, R5) in the range of about ±1.67 V. It sums the first stage output with a gain of -2 and the offset voltage gain of 3. So the output of U1B swings over about a 10 V range as the joystick is moved from one end to the other, and its central value is in the range from about -5 V to 5 V. This is the regular output.

The fourth stage (U1D) provides the inverted output. Just inverting the output of U2B would invert not only the joystick component but the offset, which isn't what we want. So to get the same sign offset, the third stage, non inverting (U1C), amplifies the original offset voltage by 3, and the fourth stage sums that with a gain of 2 and the U2B output with a gain of -1, which converts what would have been an inverted signal with inverted offset to an inverted signal with non inverted offset. This is the inverted output.
